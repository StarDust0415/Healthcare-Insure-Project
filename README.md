#### A Java GUI client for healthcare insurance project

Proposal: Providing Healthcare for Homeless People

The purpose of this project is to implement a system of providing healthcare insurance plan for homeless people and getting funding from the government.
We are imagining a charity group (HealthcareForEveryone) to be our enterprise. This group is located in Boston, MA, but multiple different cities will have similar groups which will make up the ecosystem. 
Inside the group there will be four organizations: 1) Insurance quote management department, 2) Funding management department, 3) Homeless people management department, and 4) Administrative department. 


Employee in each department will have his own user account and employee profile, which will be saved in employee directory and user account directory. Four corresponding roles – Insurance Manager Role, Funding Manager Role, People Manager Role, and Admin Role – will be assigned to users according to their departments.


The following uses cases have been implemented:
1. Insurance Quote Management: the department will be able to modify (add, update, delete) healthcare insurance quote to the system
2. Funding Management: according to the quote that’s chosen, allocate funding to the specific plan. 
3. Homeless people Management: register homeless people into the system who will be using the healthcare service. 
4.	Administrator: 
		1. If system total cash flow / budget is low, submit request to the government to ask for more funding
		2. Send updated homeless people list to the government
		3. Manage insurance services providers
		4. Manage employees
		5. Manage user accounts
